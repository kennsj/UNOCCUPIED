To date, scientists have found exoplanets in a wide variety of sizes. Some are much larger than Jupiter, while others are much smaller than Earth.</p><!--div.test--><h4>Part 02</h4><h1>What do <br /> we know?</h1><div class="title-divider"></div><p>Scientists have learned that other solar systems share similarities with our own solar system. For example, they've learned that exoplanets can orbit their stars at different distances. Some exoplanets are so close to their stars that they have surface temperatures that could melt iron.</p><p>Other exoplanets might orbit at just the right distance that they fall in their star's habitable zone, which is the zone in which an exoplanet would enjoy temperatures that would permit liquid water to exist at its surface. The existence of liquid water at the surface is one of the key factors scientists believe would permit life to form.</p><h4>Part 03</h4><h1>How many <br /> are there?</h1><div class="title-divider"></div><p>Exoplanets are now a dime a dozen. Before 1995 it was unknown whether or not other main sequence stars even hosted their own planets, but now we know that, statistically, almost every star in the galaxy is likely to have at least one planet, and many even have multiple.</p><p>Thanks to missions like Kepler we now have 3400 confirmed exoplanets and another 5400 waiting to be officially added to the list. Many of these are gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, some are Neptune like and covered in ice, but there are a few that are rocky like our home.</p><h4>Part 04</h4><h1>Any habitable <br /> exoplanets?</h1><div class="title-divider"></div><p>Of the 3400 confirmed exoplanets, there are only around 15 that fall into the category of ‘habitable’ and out of those 15, there are five that SETI astronomer Jeff Coughlin thinks are the most interesting.</p><p>Coughlin talked to us about his guidelines for what’s really considered “habitable” and what’s not. A lot of what makes a planet habitable falls into a few categories: its size, its distance from its host star, and exactly what kind of star it orbits around. What we think of as a habitable world isn’t always the same marker for scientists.</p><p>“When the everyday person hears the word habitable they probably think something like Earth or a place humans could walk out of a spaceship and be happy: there’s water, an atmosphere, gravity wouldn’t be too high, the temperature wouldn’t be too hot or too cold,” Coughlin explains. “But when astronomers talk about habitable worlds we’re really just asking about two things: could there be liquid water on what is a mostly rocky surface, nothing like Jupiter where you have a huge atmosphere crushing you down-those are really the two terms that astronomers think about. When we say a planet is habitable, that’s all we really mean."</p><p>Let’s take a tour through the four most habitable exoplanets that we know of so far.</p><div class="timeline-window"><div class="timeline-content"><h2>Kelper-186f					</h2><p>Kepler-186f (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-571.05) is an exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf Kepler-186, about 500 light-years (nearly 5.298×1015 km) from the Earth. It is the first planet with a radius similar to Earth's to be discovered in the habitable zone of another star. NASA's Kepler spacecraft detected it using the transit method, along with four additional planets orbiting much closer to the star (all modestly larger than Earth). Analysis of three years of data was required to find its signal.</p><p>It is the first planet with a radius similar to Earth's to be discovered in the habitable zone of another star.

The hunt for more Earth-like planets is ongoing, but the super earth’s are actually pretty hard to find because they orbit their star at a similar length of time that we do. Waiting a few years to to see if there's a dip in the light in front of the star is pretty challenging.</p><p>“The Kepler mission had to stare at the same patch of sky for over four years to find planets like Earth,” Coughlin says. “The big planets close to their star around small stars are the easiest to find.”</p><p>Luckily, new exoplanet announcements have become the regular for astronomers. And there are upcoming missions focused solely on searching for more exoplanets. TESS  is the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite planned to launch in 2018 and CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS)  also launching in 2018. Jeff Coughlin thinks we’ll know sometime in the next twenty to thirty years about the atmospheric conditions around some of these planets because after a few more generations of advanced telescopes the technology will be there to detect water vapor and other chemical signatures. The most important thing they’ll be looking for is what keeps us alive. “If we find oxygen around another planet it will be really exciting because the only thing on Earth that produces oxygen is life.”</p></article></section><footer><h4 class="logo">Unoccupied magazine</h4><div class="sound-bars hover-sound-beep"><div class="bar-one"></div><div class="bar-two"></div><div class="bar-three"></div><div class="bar-two"></div><div class="bar-one"></div><div class="bar-two"></div><div class="bar-three"></div><div class="bar-two"></div><div class="bar-one"></div></div></footer><audio src="sound/beep.mp3" id="beep-sound"></audio><!-- audio(src="sound/ambient1.mp3", controls, autoplay)#ambient-bg--><!-- source(src="sound/beep.mp3")--><script src="js/jquery-latest.min.js"></script><script src="js/parallax.js"></script><script src="js/TweenMax.js"></script><script src="js/velocity.js"></script><script src="js/main.js"></script></body></html>
