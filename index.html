A lot of what makes a planet habitable falls into a few categories: its size, its distance from its host star, and exactly what kind of star it orbits around. What we think of as a habitable world isn’t always the same marker for scientists.</p></div><div class="container-right"><p class="body-p">“When the everyday person hears the word habitable they probably think something like Earth or (a place) humans could walk out of a spaceship and be happy: there’s water, an atmosphere, gravity wouldn’t be too high, the temperature wouldn’t be too hot or too cold,” Coughlin explains. “But when astronomers talk about habitable worlds we’re really just asking about two things: could there be liquid water on what is a mostly rocky surface, nothing like Jupiter where you have a huge atmosphere crushing you down-those are really the two terms that astronomers think about. When we say a planet is habitable, that’s all we really mean.”</p><p class="body-p">Let’s take a tour through the four most habitable exoplanets that we know of so far.</p></div></article></div><!-- SECTION EIGHT--><div class="section section-eight imgFour img-parallax"><img src="img/img04.png"></div><!-- SECTION NINE--><div class="section section-nine"><div class="slide"><div class="menu-right"></div><article><div class="container-left exoplanet-kepler186"><div class="container"><div class="planet-image"></div></div><!-- img(src='img/01-kepler186f-2.png')--></div><div class="container-right"><div class="container-header"><h3 class="h3-headline">Habitable exoplanets:</h3><h1 class="h1-article">Kepler 186-F</h1></div><div class="container-social"><div class="divider"></div><div class="social-border"><div class="fb-icon"></div></div><div class="social-border"><div class="twitter-icon"></div></div><div class="social-border"><div class="google-icon"></div></div></div><h4 class="h4-habitable">490 LIGHT-YEARS AWAY FROM EARTH</h4><p class="body-p">Kepler-186f (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-571.05) is an exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf Kepler-186.</p><h4 class="h4-habitable">Features</h4><p class="body-p">The first truly Earth-size exoplanet found in its host stars habitable zone. <br> Kepler-186f is 10% bigger than our own planet and is almost certainly rocky.	</p></div></article></div><div class="slide"><h1>Hello</h1></div><div class="slide"></div><div class="slide"></div></div><!-- SECTION TEN--><div class="section section-eleven"><div class="menu-right"></div><article><div class="container-left"><div class="container-header"><h1 class="h1-article">What's next for <br>exoplanets?</h1></div><div class="container-social"><div class="divider"></div><div class="social-border"><div class="fb-icon"></div></div><div class="social-border"><div class="twitter-icon"></div></div><div class="social-border"><div class="google-icon"></div></div></div><p class="body-p">Planets like -452b and -62f are the closest analogs to Earth, orbiting more Sun-like stars at a distance we’re more familiar with.

And there are upcoming missions focused solely on searching for more exoplanets. TESS  is the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite planned to launch in 2018 and CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS)  also launching in 2018. Jeff Coughlin thinks we’ll know sometime in the next twenty to thirty years about the atmospheric conditions around some of these planets because after a few more generations of advanced telescopes the technology will be there to detect water vapor and other chemical signatures. The most important thing they’ll be looking for is what keeps us alive. “If we find oxygen around another planet it will be really exciting because the only thing on Earth that produces oxygen is life.”</p></div></article></div><!-- SECTION ELEVEN--><div class="section section-twelve imgFive img-parallax"><img src="img/img05.png"></div><!-- SECTION TWELVE--><div class="section section-thirteen"><div class="menu-right"></div><article><div class="container-left"><div class="container-credit"><div class="credit-list"><div class="credit-person"><h4>Journalist</h4><h5>Anish Wonders</h5></div><div class="credit-person"><h4>Designer</h4><h5>Robin AI & Kenneth J </h5></div><div class="credit-person"><h4>Developer</h4><h5>Kenneth J & Robin AI</h5></div></div></div></div><div class="container-right"><div class="container-header"><h1 class="h1-article">Related articles</h1></div><div class="container-social"><div class="divider"></div><div class="social-border"><div class="fb-icon"></div></div><div class="social-border"><div class="twitter-icon"></div></div><div class="social-border"><div class="google-icon"></div></div></div><p class="body-p">Planets like -452b and -62f are the closest analogs to Earth, orbiting more Sun-like stars at a distance we’re more familiar with.
